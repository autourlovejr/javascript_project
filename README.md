Simple Services 2.0

My project is a work in progress.  Im trying to create an application where people can sign up for services that may be needed in their personal lives.  Mainly targeting professionals in the middle/upperclass. There is a prompt message at the beginning asking if you make X amount of dollars.  Answering yes or no displays a message at the top of the page.
 I created a form that saves the entries and logs them to the console after the submit button is clicked.  I incorporated a REGEX to assure that the ten digit phone number is automatically formatted to (555)555-5555.
